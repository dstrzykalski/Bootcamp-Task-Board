# Bootcamp-Task-Board
Challenge 5 - Daved Strzykalski

## Project Description

This project serves as my 5th challenge in the coding bootcamp. The task board allows users to create and update tasks. It provides a visual representation of tasks and their corresponding status.

## Features

- Create new tasks with a title, description, and date
- Update task status
- Makes Use of Day JS (Maybe?)

## Issues
-I'm not sure if the day.js aspect is working but hopefully what feedback I receive will help me improve that feature.
